# TODOs for the project

- [ ] Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, ... until usable with models
- [ ] Organize macro data
- [ ] Double check epsilon and metric calculation with paper
- [ ] Read paper and check what's missing (e.g. FF portfolios)
- [ ] Plots
    - [ ] Scatter plot, beta vs exp return, all assets, deciles, FF
    - [ ] Neural Nets: understanding SDF weights
    - [ ] Kozak Nagel: heatmap R2 vs L1 and L2 regularization (?)
    - [ ] Pred vs Real Expected return (Figure 10 DLAP)
    - [ ] Figure 11: Feat Imp DLAP; Check average abs grad (?)
    - [ ] Figure 4: Performance with different features
    - [ ] Figure 14: 2D plots of SDF weights
